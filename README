Currently the process of generating features and creating classifiers is:
create_train_and_test_features.ipynb
add_ids_and_cosines.ipynb
classificationModel.ipynb

The other two notebooks were used to make graphs.
The pubmed* files were used to pull abstracts from pubmed.
The archive folder contains notebooks/python scripts that are not currently used, and acted as exploration for feature development.
